...


After stillness-years
Graphite regained voice
Singing father's song
Bearing wistful tears.

Lukas daughter drew.
Drawing became vow.
Music revealed how
Nadia obtains truth.

Before was always mute
Likewise dark silent night.
But now just like cuckoo
He will shout sincere clue.
I love you Nad! Please feel!
Beloved she is - she'll feel.

He came alive. Again. For real.
