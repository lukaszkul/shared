THE GREAT ONE PLUS ONE IS ONE !!!
    
    
1 + 1 = 1


focus only on this, repeat it first with words

ONE PLUS ONE IS ONE

ONE PLUS ONE IS ONE

ONE PLUS ONE IS ONE

ONE PLUS ONEIS ONE

ONE PLUS ONEISONE

ONE PLUSONEISONE

ONEPLUSONEISONE

ONEPLUSONEISONE

feel how it's flowing through your body
it gets to each tiny part of your being


it has it's own specified wave length and height
and it means that it has the frequency
and where the frequency is, there is also a vibration
it is constantly vibrating at it's current frequency
first, it's like tingling, as if the air was shaking
you can't see it at all, nothing is trembling
but you know its there cause you can feel it 
in each atom of your body

even if it is tranquility
and nothing is audible but the sound 
of your heart
it doesn't mean it's not there
it is there. it has it's own structure.
specific tone, even it's own rhythm


ONEPLUSONEISONE

ONEPLUSONEISONE

if you focus a little bit more on it
as if you float on its wave
you starting to see, that it is really 
even, it always ends at the same place
where it started, not with sound
but with its frequency

ONEPLUSONEISONE     

ONEPLUSONEISONE

ONEPLUSONEISONE

can you feel the wave?
imagine that it is a horse
or better, a camel
you sit on it's top
he starts to walk
can you feel how with his steps
you swing font and back?
imagine this ride

froooooont 
     aaaaaaand 
back again

froooooont 
     aaaaaaand 
back again

froooooont 
     aaaaaaand 
back again

can you feel it's wave?

it is even
it has it's own rhythm
it has the frequency

uuuuuuup  aand
     doooooown
...
uuuuuuup  aand
     doooooown
...
uuuuuuup  aand
     doooooown
...


now, you feel you ride this camel
you can foreseen his next move

like you are able to always predict
when you heart will beat again
you know when it happen
cause it is also even
has it's own rhythm
has it's own wave
has it's own frequency
always has it
tempo might change
but it's rhythm is 
always the same


froooooont 
     aaaaaaand 
back again

froooooont 
     aaaaaaand 
back again

froooooont 
     aaaaaaand 
back again



now, look at it as it was a pattern
like formula, you are able to describe
or even better, it's function graph
f.ex. when you ride a camel
you constantly drawing his graph
you may be surprised, but you 
are doing it with your pretty ass :)
while sitting, you have your balance 
center almost where you sit.
so, if you sync with camel, horse
doesnt matter, and actually there
is no other way to ride on them
you will fall, or get wasted after
30s of ride. but you feel it moves
you adjust, sync, like would 
be just part of it, you ride
even 100km only if the beast
will still have strengths.
so, when you sync, you draw his
function graph with you assie ass 
all the time. which means:
1. it has its frequency
2. if it has frequency, it vibrates
3. if vibrates, then it sends energy
and... energy is everything... this is the magic


so here you are, ride this camel again

froooooont 
     aaaaaaand 
back again

froooooont 
     aaaaaaand 
back again

you already know that frequency,
you remember the pattern,
unwillingly your butt knows its graph
cause already ride it, your body
synced with his graph and frequency
so even after 30 years break you can 
jump on a camel, and will just know 
how to ride it... because it's in
your body... and body has it's own
formula, and graph, and frequency
it's your heart. it gives you a rhythm
you read and you speak accordingly
to the rhythm of your heart
everybody moved aligning to it
but if you have any contact
with extarnal frequency, extarnal pattern
you must always adjust yourself to it
to be compatible, syncronize...
so no one gets hurt.
riding horse, horse has it's moves
has it's patter, graph, freqency.
In order to be able to ride it,
you must sync your body with the hourse
cause horse is a horse, and he just run
with someone on his back and will not be 
syncing... well after longer time of relation
he will always slighty adjust, cause he also learns
your patterns, your graph, and your frequency.
why? for the comfort, lower energy loss,
and just to be synced.
but it is you who need to adjust fully your body
to the rhythm of a horse, or camel
to feel comfy, and with as low energy loss
as possible. so how you sync your boyd with 
another body? it is a heart who rule
your rhythm for everything. 

take jogging for example... 
it's not just foot by foot running 
as long as you have strengths 
it is ruled by an exact pattern 
ruled by your heart of course

JOGGING:
actors: feet, arms, breath, heart


almost each time foot lands on the ground 
with you need to take some breaks off breathing
cause it would also waste you
breathing is like a working factory, 
constantly creating carbon dioxide
and actually you connstantly burn the oxygene

you dont get full breath each time your foot lands
cause you wouldn't even be able to make it, due to 
the frequency of your run and heart beats
you rather do small inhales and small exhales at a step 
it depends on your heart condition, run speed, tierenss, etc
you can't adjust your heart rhythm to your running,
so you must adjust your running to your heart rhythm
also you need to do some breaks from breathing
cause it's not about constant inhale exhale routine
breathing is not at any random moment, 
it also has its pattern, is part of formula
if you by accident make a mistake with breathing while jogging
you lose your rhythm, and with it evrything is getting out of sync
you must get back to the rhythm, starting from the first moves
thats why often you can people jogging without relocating
so they just skipping from one foot to another
they integrate breathe with the heart first,
then integrate legs, so they are aligned
and finally they integrate their arms, 
not only do they not get in the way
but they get help with keeping balance
left foot to front, right arm up
right foot front, left arm up 


accordingly to the pulse and how fast
you want run, you adjust your breath
it must be aligned with legs
and arms may even just loosely hang down
and as long as they just hanging but adjusted
with the whole body, they shouldn't bother
but also they won't help that way


each time there is a beat of heart
your foot land on the ground

then you must figure your breath pattern
I for example, Im rather poor in running
but I have my pattern:
full inhale = 3 small inhales
full exhale = 3 small exhales
breath break = 1 small


imagine this:

huu - small exhale
fyy - small inhale
--- - breath break


beat: TU   TUM   TU  TUM  TU   TUM  TU   TUM  TU   TUM  TU   TUM  TU   TUM  TU   TUM

brth: fyy  fyy   fyy ---  huu  huu  huu  ---  fyy  fyy  fyy  ---  huu  huu  huu  ---

foot: left rigt left rigt left rigt left rigt left rigt left rigt left rigt left rigt

arm : rigt left rigt left rigt left rigt left rigt left rigt left rigt left rigt left

 
and this is a pattern for running


if you have healhy lung, have any muscles,
eat some food to nourish and energize your body
and you keep to the pattern, you can run pretty much
if you do any of this randomly, you will just get tired quicly
or just say: it's not for me, I dont like it.. i dont feel it



ok, lets get to point finally

riding camel
riding horse
running, walking, talking, dancing
everything is coupled coupled with heartbeat
if doesn't.. you say you can't or you don't like

so really, crucial thing here is to find the pattern
to adjust yourself to your heart
when something else is also connected to the action, like horse 
you must not only sync your body with your heart, but also
with that beasts you ride.

everything is really just about synchronizing...
your frequency with everything else.
and since we know, that even a brick lying on the roof
has energy, so it must vibrate, and if it vibrate, then must have its frequency.

being able to adjust yourself to just anything you want 
makes you.. Neo from Matrix or Jedi Knight
Jesus did that, he walked on the water, he resurreceted Lazarus
Buddha did it, Horus did it

everything is in the heart and the mind. one can't work without the other




lets get back to our 1 + 1 = 1

there is a pattern in it
it has a rhythm, 
and frequency


ONEPLUSONEISONE     

ONEPLUSONEISONE

ONEPLUSONEISONE

ONEPUSONEISONE     

ONEPLUSONEISONE

ONEPLUSONEISONE

ONEPLUSONEISONE
     
ONEPLUSONEISONE

ONEPLUSONEISONE


can you feel it?


pampam pampam pam

pampam pampam pam

pampam pampam pam



let's now take your heartbeat and align it


TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM
pampam pampam pam // no fit


TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM
paampaam  paampaam  paam // better, but still not that 


TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM
paampam  paampam  paam  

and here we have the winner :) 
now, we need to set a talk break, 
cause we cant talk with no break,
so lets find one


TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM---TU-TUM
paampam  paampam  paam  XXXpaampam  paampam  paam  XXXpaampam  paampam  paam  XXX


pretty funny thing just happened here huh?

you have pattern, you have your way
if you have your way
than it is your way

and it is in you forever

so find your way
for 1 + 1 = 1

adjust it with your heart
live it for a moment
feel it
find your way
and this should stay with you forever
until your hart is beating.

your turn my Love :)
